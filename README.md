# 🚀 Computational Astrophysics & Pedagogy  

Welcome! I am Prof. Aaron Lee, a professor specializing in **computational astrophysics** and **scientific computing pedagogy**. My work focuses on leveraging numerical methods, simulation techniques, and modern programming approaches to explore astrophysical phenomena and enhance computational physics education.

## 🔭 **Research Interests**
- **Computational Astrophysics**: N-body simulations, fluid dynamics, radiative transfer with regards to star formation.
- **Numerical Methods**: Finite difference, Monte Carlo methods, and parallel computing.
- **Computational Pedagogy**: Developing interactive learning materials, animations, interactives, scientific computing curricula, and Python-based educational tools.

## 🏫 **Teaching & Outreach**
I am passionate about **mentoring students** and **developing computational curricula** that bridge theoretical concepts with hands-on coding experience. Some of my initiatives include:
- Designing courses on **computational physics & astrophysics**.
- Developing **interactive Jupyter notebooks** for teaching numerical methods.
- Contributing to **open educational resources** in scientific computing.
